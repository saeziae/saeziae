meow mrrp! you have discovered [estela](https://estela.moe/name/) (she/they) hugging the bl√•haj, aka `saeziae`.

computer science,<!--web, cybersecurity, machine learning, nlp--> which means clicking the keyboard randomly, wishing it giving me the program i wanted. still hoping to understand rust. i use arch, btw.

linguistics,<!-- diachronic linguistics, historical chinese phonology, generative grammar, sino-tibetan and kra-dai--> one of the most useless things in the world. i would be happy if you speak [wu language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Chinese), happier if you use [wu ime](https://github.com/saeziae/rime_nguphing).

not doing anything for 25 hours a day and feeling bad and useless.

love bed (so much!) and yummy food (and pineapple pizza), and cute skirts.

recording my earth experience with [film roll](https://estela.moe/pro/#photo).

i am sharing my photos [here](https://repo.estela.moe/wallpaper/).

infodumping for vibes: pixel art, typography, palette, retro devices, typewriter, fountain pen, anime, manga, rubik's cube, vocaloid, tecno, rhythm games, paper books, amateur radio, minecraft
