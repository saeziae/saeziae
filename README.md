Meow mrrp! You have discovered Estela (she/they) hugging the bl√•haj, aka `saeziae`.

Computer science,<!--web, cybersecurity, machine learning, NLP--> which means clicking the keyboard randomly, wishing it giving me the program I wanted. Still hoping to understand Rust. I use arch, btw.

Linguistics,<!-- Diachronic linguistics, historical Chinese phonology, generative grammar, Sino-Tibetan and Kra-Dai--> one of the most useless things in the world. I would be happy if you speak [Wu language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Chinese), happier if you use [Wu IME](https://github.com/saeziae/rime_nguphing).

Not doing anything for 25 hours a day and feeling bad and useless.

Love bed (so much!) and yummy food (and pineapple pizza), and cute skirts.

Recording my earth experience with [film roll](https://estela.moe/pro#photo).

I am sharing my photos [here](https://repo.estela.moe/wallpaper/).
